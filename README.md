Non Production Robots Ignore
===

Non Production Robots Ignore is a simple package (named in a utilitarian vein) for WordPress that is used with vlucas/phpdotenv (or similar) that sets environment variables. 

To use this: 

- Use Composer to manage your dependencies for your WordPress project
- Have type:wordpress-plugins installed in your plugins directory
- Set a `WP_ENV` environment variable and set it to anything but `production` on non-production environments. If production is set, this plugin will be ignored as desired.
- Activate the plugin
